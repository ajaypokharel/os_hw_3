/*
 * Write a multithreaded version of this algorithm to speed up this process so that you can take the advantage of 
 * multiple-core CPUs. You need to create 10 child threads. Each child thread generates 100 random points and counts 
 * the number of points that occur within the circle and passes the number to the main thread using a bounded buffer
 * that has 5 spaces. In other words, each of these child threads is a producer and the main thread is the (only)
 * consumer. Each child thread calculates and sends 100 numbers to the main thread and the main thread cumulates all 
 * these numbers. The main thread prints the estimation of Ï€ each time when it received 100 numbers from its children.
